## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A Google Cloud Platform account with YouTube Data API v3 enabled
- OAuth 2.0 credentials for the YouTube API

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-live-stream-viewer.git
   cd youtube-live-stream-viewer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```
   VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   ```
   
   > **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The repository includes a `.env.example` file as a template. Your actual API keys should only exist in your local `.env` file.

2. Select your project
3. Go to "Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
4. Edit your OAuth client
5. Add your app's origin (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for development) to "Authorized JavaScript origins"
6. Save the changes
